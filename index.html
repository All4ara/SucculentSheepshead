                                Succulents are not like most other plants. So naturally, if you try to water them like other plants, especially house plants, they aren’t going to survive!
                              <br>
                                The best way to water succulents is with the “soak and dry” method. <strong>Soak the soil completely then let the soil dry out completely before watering again.</strong> And make sure the succulents are in a well draining soil in a pot with a drainage hole (more on that in a minute).

                                Having well draining soil is crucial for succulents.
                              <br>
                                I do most of my succulent gardening in containers, both indoors and outdoors, rather than in the ground.
                              <br>
                                I’ve learned that, while improper watering of succulents is a major cause of succulent deaths. The correct soil is a much bigger contributing factor than people realize.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Criteria for “Good” Succulent Soil</h2>
                              <p>
                                The best soil for succulents in pots will hold enough water for them to absorb what they need, but still dries out quickly so the roots won’t rot.
                              <br>
                                Succulents absorb water from the air around them, not through direct contact.
                              <br>
                                Constantly sitting in wet soil causes their roots to rot, because they get too much water–eventually, the cells in the roots and leaves fall apart, causing the plant to die.
                              </p>

                              <h2>The Perfect Indoor Succulent Soil</h2>
                              <p>
                                I grow a lot of succulents indoors. Since indoor environments don’t offer as much air circulation around indoor pots, I’ve found that using the right soil is extremely important for the health of indoor succulents.
                              <br>
                                I highly recommend using a soil with a large particle size, roughly 1/4″ or 6mm.  
                              </p>

                              <h2>Start with a good photo</h2>
                              <p>
                                You’ll always need a good photo to ID your succulent (unless you are asking someone in person). Try to photograph the plant on its own rather than in an arrangement.
                              <br>
                                Make sure the succulent is well lit. If you are photographing in a dark area or sometimes indoors, you may get a weird color cast which can make the color of the plant look different.
                              <br>
                              The moral of the story is get the best picture you can of your succulent. The better the picture, the more likely people will be able to identify the plant.

                                <em>Find out the best planting tips for succulent container gardens! You’ll discover common mistakes to avoid when planting succulents in containers!</em>
                              <br>
                                While planting succulents is pretty straightforward, there are a few things that will help ensure your succulents grow healthy. This post will point out a few tips that aren’t very well known, but make a big difference.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Plant above the rim</h2>
                              <strong>In order to stay healthy, your succulent needs to sit above the rim of the pot.</strong>
                              <br>
                              <p>
                                If your soil is below the rim of the pot, water can easily pool up. The leaves inside the pot will quickly rot from the water and that can cause problems for the rest of the plant.
                              <br>
                                I say to fill the pot partially with soil and then put your succulent in. This will help you see if your plant is above the pot or below. Don’t just put the roots in an empty pot. Give it a base to sit on.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Pack it tight… or not…</h2>
                              <p>
                                I’ve had several people ask me lately how much space needs to be between the succulents in their arrangement. The answer is… it depends. You can definitely plant succulents very close together and they will be just fine.
                              <br>
                                When planting succulents close together they grow more slowly so they maintain the original design of the arrangement better. It can be trickier to water them when they are close together. But, especially if you’re designing the arrangement as a gift or for an event, this is really great way to plant your succulents.
                              <br>
                                You can also leave a little more space between your succulents and they’ll grow a little quicker (although they are pretty slow growers in general) and over time they’ll fill in. This is a great option if you’d like for your plants to get bigger or reproduce on their own more easily. If you are just starting out with succulents I’d recommend taking this slightly spaced out approach.
                              <br>
                                When there is space between the plants it’s easier to water the succulents properly. There is also better air flow so the soil will dry out more quickly. We know that quick drying soil makes for happy succulents!
                              <br>
                                Too much space will cause the succulents to focus on producing roots rather than getting larger. I would say that 1/2″ to 1″ is a good space between plants.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Let succulents hang over the edge of your pot</h2>
                              <p>
                                This is a design tip rather than an absolute necessity for healthy succulents. But, since we talked about making sure your succulents are above the rim of the pot, I thought it would be good to mention it.
                              <br>
                                To make your arrangement a little more interesting, place some succulents so they hang over the edge of your pot. You can use trailing succulents (such as “String of Pearls“) that actually hang over the side of the pot, or just let the leaves of your rosette cover the edge of the pot. Here are examples of arrangements done both ways.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Add some height</h2>
                              <p>
                                While we are talking design… another great way to make your arrangement interesting is to add a tall succulent or “thriller”. Add some shorter succulents around it, “filler”, and then the trailing succulents mentioned before, “spiller.” I have found this concept of thriller, filler, spiller to be a great “recipe” for creating an arrangement.
                              <br>
                                This isn’t a hard fast rule, but if you’re looking for a great way to make a statement, this is a good place to start. In this arrangement, I’ve used Kalanchoe tomentosa for my thriller, Echeveria ‘Topsy Turvy’ and Graptopetalum paraguayense for my fillers, with Sedum ‘burrito’ and Senecio rowleyanus (String of Pearls) for my spillers.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Use a top dressing and pot feet</h2>
                              <p>
                                Be sure to finish off your arrangement by using a top dressing. Your design will look more professional. As always, be sure to use a pot with a drainage hole and if your arrangement is outside, use pot feet to give your plants better airflow.
                              </p>

                                Wondering how to save a dying succulent? Or are you worried that your succulent may be dying due to over- or under-watering? Find out how to tell for sure in this post!
                              <br>
                                I get quite a few emails from concerned succulent lovers, asking why their beloved plants are dying. Sometimes there’s actually nothing wrong with their plants.
                              <br>
                                Other times, the problem is that the plant has been over- or under-watered–and it can be hard to tell which! I’m going to give you some helpful hints in this post so you can diagnose what’s going wrong!
                              </p>

                              <h2>Dried out, dying leaves</h2>
                              <p>
                                First of all, it’s important to keep in mind that dying leaves are a natural part of every plant’s life — and succulents are no exception. This doesn’t always mean that your succulent is dying, or that you’re doing anything wrong.
                              <br>
                                As your plant grows, it creates new leaves, while the older ones die. So, if you’re seeing dry, crispy leaves at the bottom of the plant–and only at the bottom– there’s no need to worry. This is normal!
                              <br>
                                If the dry leaves start to get unsightly, just gently pull them away from the base of the plant and throw them away. When you remove the leaves, keep your plant potted so you don’t disturb the roots.
                              <br>
                                Only pull off the leaves that come off easily, or are totally dead. Here, I pulled the plant out of the pot to better show you what dead leaves on a healthy plant look like.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Over-watering</h2>
                              <p>
                                While dead leaves at the bottom of your succulent are perfectly healthy, dead leaves on the upper parts of new growth are a sign of a problem–usually over- or under-watering. Soil can also cause problems for succulents, as I explain in this article.
                              <br>
                                If your plant’s leaves are starting to look yellow and transparent, and feel soggy or mushy to the touch, it’s likely suffered from overwatering.
                              <br>
                                An early sign of over-watering is that leaves will start to fall off with just a slight bump. If you start to notice soft black spots on your plant’s leaves or stem, the over-watering is getting severe, and it may be difficult to save your succulent.
                              <br>
                                Some succulents are more sensitive to over-watering than others. Echeverias seem to be one of the most sensitive. After just two or three days with too much water, these beautiful rosettes will be on a fast track to rot.
                              <br>
                                The best way to avoid over-watering is to make sure your soil is completely dried out before watering again. As I’ve said in a lot of my other articles, most succulents can easily go three days (and sometimes even a week or more) without water–so when it doubt, wait before watering.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Under-watering</h2>
                              <p>
                                While over-watering succulents is the most common problem, many succulents are also sensitive to under-watering. I’ve found that Portulacaria afra and Senecio haworthii like to be watered more frequently than other succulents.
                              <br>
                                If your plant’s upper leaves are starting to wrinkle and get dry and crispy, then it’s probably time to give your succulents a little more water. 
                              <br>
                                For the most part, it’s much easier to revive an under-watered succulent than an over-watered one. If yours are just starting to wrinkle, they’ll probably perk up pretty quickly after one or two watering cycles. However, if they’ve almost completely shriveled up, I’m sorry to tell you that they’re probably too far gone to recover.
                              <br>
                              To help them recover best from under watering, make sure you soak the soil really well when you water. Make sure you check out my post on how to water succulents to do this the right way.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Other Problems</h2>
                              <p>
                                While over or under watering tends to be the most common problem new succulent growers face, there are a few more issues you may run into. These may include: stretching out, bug infestations, internal infections, and more.
                              <br>
                                As you pay close attention to your succulents you’ll be able to see early signs of problems which will make it much easier to save your succulent before things get too out of hand.

                                <em>Mealy bugs are one of the most common pests that infect succulents. Learn a simple way to get rid of them that is safe for the succulents!</em>
                              <br>
                                If you’re growing succulents indoors (and possibly if you’re growing succulents outdoors), you are likely to encounter mealybugs at some point. If not, lucky you!
                              <br>
                                Mealybugs are like a plague. They spread quickly from plant to plant and it can be difficult to get rid of them. Fortunately, I’ve discovered a simple way to kill them that also keeps your succulents safe from burning or other problems normal pesticides may cause.
                              </p>

                              <h2>What are mealybugs?</h2>
                              <p>
                                Mealybugs are nasty little bugs that like to eat new growth on succulents. It’s difficult to say exactly what causes them to show up, but overwatering is a common cause, as well as over fertilizing. They tend to show up on indoor plants the most as the temperatures are more temperate, but they can show up on succulents outdoors too!
                              <br>
                                These little guys usually hang out in a white web-like substance in the nooks and crannies of your succulent. Their favorite place to hide is right where the leaves meet up with the stem. This makes them hard to see and hard to kill.
                              <br>
                                If they aren’t treated quickly, mealybugs will spread all over a succulent and to nearby succulents as well. It’s impressive how quickly they move, and frustrating too. As they move, they eat away at the succulent. Often, this will stunt the growth of the plant and cause the new growth to look mis-shaped or smaller than usual. They may also leave some dents in the leaves if they are left for too long.
                              </p>

                              <h2>How can I get rid of mealybugs?</h2>
                              <p>
                                The video below shows the technique I use to get rid of mealybugs from succulents using isopropyl alcohol. You can also read the details of this method in the sections that follow.
                              <br>
                                While many plant pesticides will kill mealybugs, the best solution I’ve found to kill them is 70% isopropyl alcohol. Many people recommend using q-tips to dab on the alcohol, but I’ve found that a spray bottle is much more effective and easier to use.
                              <br>
                                I actually keep a little travel sized spray bottle next to my plants so I can kill the nasty things as soon as they show up. I do use a larger one if the infestation gets out of hand or affects very many plants.
                              <br>
                                When you first notice the mealybugs, move your infected plants away from everything else. Mealybugs spread quickly and you don’t want to risk other plants getting infected.
                              <br>
                                To kill the mealybugs with the alcohol, simply spray the alcohol directly on the mealybugs, wherever they are on the succulent.
                              <br>
                                Be sure to check those hard to see places near the stem. Spray them really well with the alcohol. You’ll notice the web-like substance will almost disappear as soon as you spray them and a little brownish/black bug, the size of a crumb will be left.
                              <br>
                                Generally, if you catch the mealybugs early just one round of alcohol spray will be enough to kill them. If you didn’t quite get them all though, they may come back in a day or two. Continue to spray them until they don’t come back.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Other Pests</h2>
                              <p>
                                Mealybugs aren’t the only pests to plague succulents. Many succulent growers suffer from gnats, too. This video will teach you why your succulent soil has gnats, and a simple solution to get rid of them.
